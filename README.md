# Secure Node.js Backend with JWT Authentication

This project is a robust and secure backend application built with **Node.js**, implementing **JWT-based authentication** and advanced security practices. It is designed with scalability and performance in mind, leveraging modern middleware for logging, rate limiting, and protection against common vulnerabilities like XSS and NoSQL injection.

## üöÄ Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication using public/private PEM keys (RS256).
- **Logging**: Detailed request logging with Morgan and a custom logger utility.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents excessive API requests with a configurable rate limiter.
- **Security Enhancements**:
  - CORS with custom configuration.
  - Helmet for secure HTTP headers.
  - Protection against XSS attacks with `xss-clean`.
  - Prevention of NoSQL injection attacks with `express-mongo-sanitize`.
- **Performance**: Optimized API interactions with response compression.
- **Validation**: Ensures secure and valid user input with `express-validator`.
- **Extensibility**: Modular folder structure for scalability and easy maintenance.
- **Session Management**: Refresh token mechanism for seamless session handling.
