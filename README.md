## Security Features

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Handled by**: `xss-clean`, `helmet`, input validation (`express-validator`).
- **Protection**: Sanitizes user inputs to prevent malicious scripts from being executed in the client‚Äôs browser.

### NoSQL Injection and MongoDB Query Injection
- **Handled by**: `express-mongo-sanitize`.
- **Protection**: Removes `$` and `.` operators from inputs to prevent malicious queries.

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Misconfiguration
- **Handled by**: `cors` with `corsOptions`.
- **Protection**: Restricts allowed origins, methods, and headers to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **Handled by**: `helmet`.
- **Protection**: Prevents unauthorized scripts, images, or other resources from being loaded into the application.

### Clickjacking
- **Handled by**: `helmet`.
- **Protection**: Adds `X-Frame-Options` headers to prevent the application from being embedded in iframes.

### Data Breach via Cookie Hijacking
- **Handled by**: `cookie-parser`, secure cookie configurations (`httpOnly`, `secure`, `sameSite`).
- **Protection**: Protects cookies from being accessed or manipulated by client-side scripts or in unsafe environments.

### Brute Force Attacks on Authentication
- **Handled by**: Rate limiting (`loginLimiter`, `registerLimiter`).
- **Protection**: Limits login/register attempts from a single IP within a time window.

### Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Handled by**: `compression`, rate limiting.
- **Protection**: Reduces response payload size and limits request rates to mitigate resource exhaustion.

### Unsecured HTTP Headers
- **Handled by**: `helmet`.
- **Protection**: Adds secure headers like `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, etc., to protect against header-based vulnerabilities.

### Broken Authentication
- **Handled by**: JWT-based authentication and refresh token mechanisms with secure algorithms (e.g., `RS256`).
- **Protection**: Ensures token validity using private/public key pairs to avoid tampering.

### Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MITM)
- **Handled by**: Secure HTTPS configuration.
- **Protection**: Ensures sensitive data is transmitted securely over HTTPS.

### Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Handled by**: `express-validator`.
- **Protection**: Ensures user inputs conform to expected formats, reducing risks of malformed or malicious inputs.

### Excessive Data Exposure
- **Handled by**: Explicit field selection in database queries (e.g., `user.findById(...).select(...)`).
- **Protection**: Limits unnecessary exposure of sensitive data in API responses.

### Replay Attacks
- **Handled by**: Token expiration and rotation mechanisms (access and refresh tokens).
- **Protection**: Prevents old or duplicate tokens from being reused.

## Needs to be completed

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Protection**: When enabled, ensures requests originate from trusted sources with valid CSRF tokens.
