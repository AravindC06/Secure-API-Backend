# Secure Node.js Backend with JWT Authentication

This project is a robust and secure backend application built with **Node.js**, implementing **JWT-based authentication** and advanced security practices. It is designed with scalability and performance in mind, leveraging modern middleware for logging, rate limiting, and protection against common vulnerabilities like XSS and NoSQL injection.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication using public/private PEM keys (RS256).
- **Logging**: Detailed request logging with Morgan and a custom logger utility.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents excessive API requests with a configurable rate limiter.
- **Security Enhancements**:
  - CORS with custom configuration.
  - Helmet for secure HTTP headers.
  - Protection against XSS attacks with `xss-clean`.
  - Prevention of NoSQL injection attacks with `express-mongo-sanitize`.
- **Performance**: Optimized API interactions with response compression.
- **Validation**: Ensures secure and valid user input with `express-validator`.
- **Extensibility**: Modular folder structure for scalability and easy maintenance.
- **Session Management**: Refresh token mechanism for seamless session handling.

- **dotenv**: Manages environment variables securely.
- **cors**: Configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **helmet**: Sets secure HTTP headers to prevent attacks.
- **xss-clean**: Sanitizes user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- **express-mongo-sanitize**: Protects against NoSQL injection.
- **cookie-parser**: Parses cookies in HTTP requests.
- **morgan**: Logs HTTP requests for debugging and monitoring.
- **compression**: Compresses HTTP responses for improved performance.
- **rate-limiter-flexible**: Implements configurable API request limits.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

1. **CORS**: Restricts API access based on allowed origins, enhancing security.
2. **Helmet**: Adds secure HTTP headers to mitigate common vulnerabilities.
3. **xss-clean**: Sanitizes input data to prevent XSS attacks.
4. **express-mongo-sanitize**: Protects the database from injection attacks.
5. **Rate Limiting**: Limits repeated requests to prevent brute-force attacks.

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

- **Response Compression**: Reduces payload size for faster API interactions.
- **Efficient Logging**: Logs API usage with Morgan for better debugging.
- **Modular Design**: Simplifies codebase scaling and maintenance.

---

## üîí Security Best Practices

- **Input Validation**: Validates all user inputs with `express-validator`.
- **Error Handling**: Uses centralized middleware for consistent error responses.
- **Token Management**: Utilizes short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens.
- **Environment Variables**: Stores sensitive information securely in `.env` files.
- **Database Security**: Protects against SQL/NoSQL injection with sanitization.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

1. **OAuth Integration**: Add support for third-party authentication providers (e.g., Google, GitHub).
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Implement structured logging with tools like Winston.
3. **Monitoring**: Integrate monitoring solutions like New Relic or DataDog.
4. **GraphQL API**: Extend the REST API with GraphQL for efficient data querying.
